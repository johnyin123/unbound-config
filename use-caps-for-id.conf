    # Use  0x20-encoded  random  bits  in  the  query  to  foil  spoof
    # attempts.  This perturbs the lowercase and  uppercase  of  query
    # names  sent  to  authority servers and checks if the reply still
    # has the correct casing.  Disabled by default.  This  feature  is
    # an experimental implementation of draft dns-0x20.
